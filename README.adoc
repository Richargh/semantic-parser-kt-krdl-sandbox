= Semantic Parsing with Kotlin (Sandbox)

link:https://github.com/github/semantic[Semantic] is a Github project for parsing, analyzing, and comparing source code.
It is language agnostic and supports Js/Ts/Python/Ruby and many more languages.

One of the things it can do is to transform code in the supported languages to a common json format, see link:https://github.com/github/semantic/blob/master/docs/examples.md[docs/examples]. That is the format that Github uses to provide code navigation.

Maybe we can also use this format to generate metrics for any of the languages Semantic supports.

The project is divided into two parts:

* parser: for parsing semantic json files
* language-examples: where we store code esxamples to analyze with semantic and transform into json files

== Getting Started Parser

`gradlew build`

== Getting Started Language Examples

=== Via Docker

* Pull semantic docker image `docker pull ghcr.io/github/semantic/semantic`
